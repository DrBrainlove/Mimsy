Mimsy - extends LXGraphModel


  Dodeahedron

  Tetrahedron - extends LXGraphModel
    Nodes, Bars

  Tetrahedra



  LXGraphModel needs to be nestable

    pass existing nodes/bars to it, or a whole LXGraphModel

    need to detect shared nodes/bars, but in sub-models only traverse
      connections within the subgraph

    but if the larger model is composed of submodels, it will be the only one
    that knows about all the connectinos

    however, if the nodes are going to be shared, they need to be creatd first,
    at the top level, so they can be passed to each subgraph in order to reference
    the right node

    nodes can track which subgraphs they are part of?

    well right now, only solving for tetrahedral connections, so no shared
    nodes or bars between thme.

    do need to about the mapping from the dodecahedron to the tetrahedra though.

    trying to manage multiple copies of each node, for face, tetra left, etc,
    will be a wild pain in the ass.
